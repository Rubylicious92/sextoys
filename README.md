# Sex Toys
This repo will focus on building a consumer friendly web page offering just the best of Sex Toys. 
With only a simple HTML script and some build in CSS this website will serve as a demo for future projects to come.

A live demo of the site can be found here: 

## What I learned 

The main challenge was to set up several pages and linking them together. In addition to that there has been a successful test of build in CSS to make it look more appealing. This process was marked with several attemps adjusting font and picture sizes until a satisfying style was found. 
However the external sheet hasn't worked out the way I intended. 

### Glimpse into the future

With the first website set up, there are many more to follow. Especially the kind of sites using Flexbox and Javascript in order to enhance user friendliness. So stay tuned.
